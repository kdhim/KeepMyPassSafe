The content below is an example project proposal / requirements document. Replace the text below the lines marked "__TODO__" with details specific to your project. Remove the "TODO" lines.

(___TODO__: your project name_)

# Shoppy Shoperson 

## Overview

(___TODO__: a brief one or two paragraph, high-level description of your project_)

KeepMyPassSafe is a password storage utility that automatically encrypts all of your sensitive account information. 

To begin, navigate to the homepage and enter a private key that will give you access to your accounts.

It is highly recommended that you write down the private key somewhere secure, or at least create a key that is easy for you to remember. Each time you enter your private key successfully, the app will automatically redirect your browser to a randomly generated URL which is only available in your current session. This mitigates attacks by eavesdroppers or by looking at browser history.

Once you are on your access page, you can then create a new Folder, which is a group of similar accounts. For example, all of your online shopping accounts (Amazon, Ebay, Etsy, etc) can go into one Folder. Within the Folder, you can add new accounts and view existing accounts.


## Data Model

(___TODO__: a description of your application's data and their relationships to each other_) 

The application will store Users, Folders, and Accounts.

* a user has a unique private key. each user will have multiple folders.
* each folder will have multiple accounts.
* each account will have a user-friendly name and the login information.

(___TODO__: sample documents_)

An Example User:

```javascript
{
  username: "shannonshopper",
  hash: // a password hash,
  lists: // an array of references to List documents
}
```

An Example List with Embedded Items:

```javascript
{
  user: // a reference to a User object
  name: "Breakfast foods",
  items: [
    { name: "pancakes", quantity: "9876", checked: false},
    { name: "ramen", quantity: "2", checked: true},
  ],
  createdAt: // timestamp
}
```


## [Link to Commented First Draft Schema](db.js) 

(___TODO__: create a first draft of your Schemas in db.js and link to it_)

## Wireframes

(___TODO__: wireframes for all of the pages on your site; they can be as simple as photos of drawings or you can use a tool like Balsamiq, Omnigraffle, etc._)

/list/create - page for creating a new shopping list

![list create](documentation/list-create.png)

/list - page for showing all shopping lists

![list](documentation/list.png)

/list/slug - page for showing specific shopping list

![list](documentation/list-slug.png)

## Site map

(___TODO__: draw out a site map that shows how pages are related to each other_)

Here's a [complex example from wikipedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Sitemap_google.jpg), but you can create one without the screenshots, drop shadows, etc. ... just names of pages and where they flow to.

## User Stories or Use Cases

(___TODO__: write out how your application will be used through [user stories](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story#Format) and / or [use cases](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center?jmp=docs&_ga=1.47552679.1838903181.1489282706#previous)_)

1. as non-registered user, I can register a new account with the site
2. as a user, I can log in to the site
3. as a user, I can create a new grocery list
4. as a user, I can view all of the grocery lists I've created in a single list
5. as a user, I can add items to an existing grocery list
6. as a user, I can cross off items in an existing grocery list

## Research Topics

(___TODO__: the research topics that you're planning on working on along with their point values... and the total points of research topics listed_)

* (5 points) Integrate user authentication
    * I'm going to be using passport for user authentication
    * And account has been made for testing; I'll email you the password
    * see <code>cs.nyu.edu/~jversoza/ait-final/register</code> for register page
    * see <code>cs.nyu.edu/~jversoza/ait-final/login</code> for login page
* (4 points) Perform client side form validation using a JavaScript library
    * see <code>cs.nyu.edu/~jversoza/ait-final/my-form</code>
    * if you put in a number that's greater than 5, an error message will appear in the dom
* (5 points) vue.js
    * used vue.js as the frontend framework; it's a challenging library to learn, so I've assigned it 5 points

10 points total out of 8 required points (___TODO__: addtional points will __not__ count for extra credit_)


## [Link to Initial Main Project File](app.js) 

(___TODO__: create a skeleton Express application with a package.json, app.js, views folder, etc. ... and link to your initial app.js_)

## Annotations / References Used

(___TODO__: list any tutorials/references/etc. that you've based your code off of_)

1. [passport.js authentication docs](http://passportjs.org/docs) - (add link to source code that was based on this)
2. [tutorial on vue.js](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) - (add link to source code that was based on this)
